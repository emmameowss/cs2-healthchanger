# cs2-healthchanger
CounterStrikeSharp plugin for changing player's health.

# Install Guide
This is genuinely painful to install if you don't have an existing CS2DS up with CounterStrikeSharp installed so instead of writing out every step I'm just gonna make a video.

-- TBA ADD VIDEO --

# Demo Guide
1. Launch Counter-Strike 2
2. Make sure Developer Console is enabled (Settings - Game - Enable Developer Console = Yes)
3. In Developer Console type "connect cs2demo.emmameowss.gay; password som.test08"
4. In chat, run ".health <name> <health>" where name is the Steam Profile name of the user whose health you want to change (in this case most likely you, can also be SteamID64) and health the amount of health you want to set to.
